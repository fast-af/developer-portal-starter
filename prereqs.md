# Fast Overview and Prerequisites
## Overview
Fast is an application that business owners can connect to their online stores to create quick, efficient checkout experiences for shoppers. Once you have installed Fast into your online store, your customers can experience speedy one-click checkouts. For example, maybe before, shoppers at an online store like Janesbooks.com had to fill out a lengthy order form. With Fast, shoppers can buy books with one click.
## Prerequisite Basics
To use Fast, as a prerequisite, you need an online store hosted by BigCommerce, Woocommerce, or a custom system. Below are more details on what that means.
## Prerequisite Details
If you have an online store, you might already use an ecommerce platform to host that store. such as BigCommerce or Woocommerce. Alternatively, you might host your store with a custom system that you set up yourself or you had an independent contractor build for your specific business.

For example, if Jane sells books on Janesbooks.com, that online store on Jane’s website is powered by the ecommerce platform, BigCommerce. Jane’s neighbor, Mary, sells shoes on Marysshoes.com, but her website has a custom system through which she sells. Mary paid a developer to set up that custom system for her.
## Options For Hosting an Online Store
If you’re new to creating an online store, you may still be considering how to build it. Here is more information about these three hosting options:
**BigCommerce**: This ecommerce platform is an excellent choice for sellers without developer experience who want to focus on selling their products. It’s less customizable than other options.
**WooCommerce**: This ecommerce platform choice works great for sellers with tech skills who want lots of customizable options and plugins to add to their online store. WooCommerce is built directly into WordPress.
**Custom System**: You or someone you worked with might have created a custom system to power your online store, as opposed to using a pre-existing ecommerce platform like BigCommerce or WooCommerce. This option is the most technical, but gives you the most control over your store.
