The simplest implementation of Fast Headless Checkout requires only providing a Fast Headless Checkout URL along with a few URL query parameters (at bare minimum `app_id` and `product_id`, though more parameters may be required depending on the store platform, and others may be recommended). The specific implementation of Fast Headless Checkout for your platform will depend on if your Platform is enabled to use the Fast Product Display Page (FPDP). FPDP-enabled platforms should fully support Fast Headless Checkout, while FPDP-disabled platforms will only have limited support for Fast Headless Checkout.
