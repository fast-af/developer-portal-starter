:::warning Limited Fast Headless Checkout Support for FPDP-Disabled Platforms

Currently, Fast Headless Checkout is only fully supported for FPDP-enabled platforms.

For FPDP-disabled platforms, Fast currently recommends against using Headless Checkout with live products that have multiple variants. For the time being, until the FPDP is enabled for your platform, the use of Headless Checkout should generally be limited to test cases, one-off cases built with the help of a Fast team member, or products in your store that only have a single variant.

Please contact seller-support@fast.co if you have additional questions about using Fast Headless Checkout with your platform.
