Due to AMP's restrictions (e.g. around loading custom JavaScript, DOM manipulation, etc.) it is not possible to load `fast.js` nor use the typical `<fast-checkout-button>` custom element on AMP pages. If you would like to embed a Fast Checkout button on a page using AMP, the preferred method is to embed a CSS-only version of the Fast Checkout button to open a Fast Headless Checkout URL for the product to be purchased.

These steps will provide a walkthrough for placing a Fast Checkout button on your AMP page, as well as how to construct a Fast Headless Checkout URL for a given product that will work with the platform for your online store.
