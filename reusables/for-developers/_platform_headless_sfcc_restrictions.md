:::warning Salesforce Commerce Cloud Recommendation: Use Variant ID Instead of Product Options

Product options (`option_values` for Fast Headless Checkout URL; `product_options` for `<fast-checkout-button>` HTML attribute) are not currently reliably supported for Fast Headless Checkout URLs to products in SFCC stores.

It is for this reason that Fast recommends specifying a variant ID for Fast Headless Checkout instead of specifying product options. This may change in the future.
