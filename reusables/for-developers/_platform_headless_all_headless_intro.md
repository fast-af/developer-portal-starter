Fast Headless Checkout enables you to share links to specific products outside of your online storefront. Meet shoppers where they are on social platforms, on review sites, referred by affiliates, or even physically in the real world. Attracting shoppers to your online storefront to explore your full product catalog may often be the ultimate goal, but the first step to fostering customer loyalty is almost always to get that first product in their hands. Any future customer engagements, whether earning repeat business from satisfied customers or gaining exposure through outreach to a variety of growing communities, needs that initial spark. Using Fast Headless Checkout doesn't require any scripts, and can be used without the `fast.js` script.
