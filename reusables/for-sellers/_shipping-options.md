The shipping options presented to the customer are the shipping options you have enabled on BigCommerce / WooCommerce and will be available to the customer during the 5-minute checkout process. During the 5-minute checkout process the buyer has the ability to update their shipping method. If no shipping method is selected the default will be whichever option is least expensive to the customer.

### Minimum Shipping Thresholds

We batch orders if a single customer places multiple orders within a 5 minute window, so the final order will include all purchases within 5 minutes. Your customer will receive 1 order confirmation and the final purchase will reflect the total cost. Your shipping system will also receive 1 order, and can then determine appropriate shipping costs, packaging, and timelines as determined by your shipping system settings.

### Minimum Processing Volume

We do not have a minimum processing volume.
