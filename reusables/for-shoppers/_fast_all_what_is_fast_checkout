Fast Checkout enables one-click purchases **without** requiring a password to log in. Sign in just once on a given device, and Fast remembers your account and payment information without compromising security.

Once you've completed the easy initial setup with Fast, whenever you see a **Fast Checkout** button on your favorite website, just press the **Checkout** button and your order is immediately confirmed. Avoid the hassle of managing a cart, re-entering shipping or payment information, or otherwise slowing down your purchasing experience.

And if you do need to change anything, you can add, modify, or even cancel your order for up to **5 minutes** after clicking **Checkout**, with no penalties. Add or remove items, or end the timer early if you're done. Once the 5-minute window closes we process your payment and your merchant gets your order ready to go.

:::info Extending or terminating the 5-minute checkout window

If you use Fast Checkout to add another item to your order before the 5-minute window closes, the timer will reset back 5 minutes, giving you additional time to add more items or review your order.

You also have the option to end the timer early and complete your order at any time.
