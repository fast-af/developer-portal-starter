# Sign Up with WooCommerce
## Prerequisites
Before you begin this process, you’ll need an online store hosted by WooCommerce. See Fast Overview and Prerequisites for more information about this and other prerequisites. If you need help at any point, contact customer success at seller-support@fast.co.

1. On fast.co/business, enter the following information and click “Next:”
- Your company email address (if you enter in a personal email address or a different email than what you want to use, you can change this later)
- Your first name (If your business has multiple employees, the person signing up can add other sellers to the Fast account, later, and give other employees permissions.)
- Your last name
