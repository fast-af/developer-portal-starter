# Update your shipping address

## In your Dashboard

![shipping address sidebar option](/images/shipping-address.png)

To add or edit shipping addresses for _future_ purchases with Fast:

1. Log in to the Fast Buyer Dashboard at [fast.co/profile](https://www.fast.co/profile).
2. Click on the [Address](https://www.fast.co/profile/address) icon found in the left navigation panel.
3. Click the "Add address" button to add in your new shipping address.

If you want to keep several addresses on file, you must first select a "default" shipping address. Once you have selected a "default" option, you can add, edit, or delete other addresses on file.

:::warning Cannot Delete Default Address

You cannot delete a default shipping address from your profile (i.e. you will need to have another address on file, make it your default option, and then delete the previous default shipping address from your profile).

:::

## During the 5 minute checkout window

Also, during the 5-minute checkout process you have the ability to update your shipping address to a different option listed on your dashboard or you can add a new one during this time. If a shipping address is not added or selected, the "default" shipping address listed in your dashboard will be selected.

## For Current orders past the 5 minute checkout window

If you need to update your address on a current order, please reach out directly to the merchant for assistance. Please refrain from using autofill when adding your address information, as autofill may input your address incorrectly.
