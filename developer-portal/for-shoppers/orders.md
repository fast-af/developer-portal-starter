# Orders

**We believe that usernames and passwords are a thing of the past.**

Fast Checkout enables one-click purchases _without requiring a password to log in_! Sign in just once on a given device, and Fast remembers your account and payment information, without compromising security.

When you see a Fast Checkout button on your favorite website (and have already signed up for Fast), **press the Checkout button and your order is confirmed**. There’s no need to add items to a cart - but you can add to or edit your order for up to five minutes! Then, we process your payment and your merchant gets your order ready to go!

When you use Fast products and services, we use alternative authentication methods that don’t involve usernames and passwords, so you’ll never have to worry about remembering or using them ever again!

Explore this section to learn more about how Fast works, how we protect your information, process orders, and make it easy – and FAST – to buy your favorite products across the internet without filling out long, tiresome forms.
