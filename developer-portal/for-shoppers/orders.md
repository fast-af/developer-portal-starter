# Orders

As a shopper, once you have completed your first checkout, you can view order details from your [Fast Dashboard](https://fast.co) or by clicking the order link provided in the confirmation email you received when you made your purchase.

It is important to note that a the Fast Checkout process creates an order once completed (either with a confirmed purchase after the 5-minute batching window, or upon order cancellation).

## Order Details

When you view an order, you can see details including:

- store
- date of purchase
- order ID
- Fast Transaction Number
- shipping details (including address and tracking numbers)

Additionally, you will be able to view:

- list of items in the order
- item details
- links to contact the store

You will also see a "Buy Again" option that you can use if you wish to re-purchase the same item from that store.
