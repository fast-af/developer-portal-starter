# Promo codes

## Where do I put a promo code?

You can use promo codes in the pop-up Order Confirmation page:

<img alt="order confirmation page" src="./images/order-confirmation-page.png"/>

You will receive confirmation of the discounted price you paid in your 2nd "Order Processing" email, to accommodate any edits made during the 5 minute batching window.
