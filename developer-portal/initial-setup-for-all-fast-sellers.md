Full pricing details can be found on the [Fast Pricing page](https://fast.co/pricing). The pricing page also provides a breakdown of pricing for all countries where Fast supports Sellers.

### Supported Countries, Currencies, and Languages

#### Supported Countries for Fast Sellers

As mentioned above, you can confirm that Fast supports Sellers in your country using the [Fast Pricing page](https://fast.co/pricing). In order to be a Seller with Fast, we must be able to issue a cross-border payment in your country's native currency (more details here: https://stripe.com/docs/connect/cross-border-payouts).

If you attempt to [onboard as a Seller](https://v2.fast.co/get-started) from an unsupported country, the Seller onboarding process will terminate and you will receive a message thanking you for your interest (though Fast will follow up at a later date once you are eligible to onboard as a Seller).
