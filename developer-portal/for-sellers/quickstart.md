# Fast Seller Quickstart

## Overview

Fast connects to your online store so that each of your customers with a Fast account can experience one-click checkouts. Allowing your customers to avoid filling out lengthy checkout forms can lead to increased conversion rates and a better experience for shoppers.

## Requirements

For many Sellers, the simplest setup to start using Fast will involve an integration with an online store hosted by a [supported eCommerce platform](/developer-portal/for-developers/platforms.mdx).

Alternatively, you can also use Fast via a [custom API integration](/developer-portal/for-developers/custom-integration.md) with your self-hosted online store. This option is the most technical, but gives you the most control over your store.

## Becoming a Seller with Fast

The first step to integrating Fast Checkout with your store is to become a seller with Fast.

### Onboarding Summary

The Seller Onboarding process will require you to:

- provide details about your organization
- provide integration details for your online storefront (e.g. if your store's website domain is hosted by a supported eCommerce platform or if you will need to do a custom integration)
- complete technical integration steps to connect your store to Fast
- verify your business
- confirm banking details
- complete other onboarding tasks.

## Looking Ahead

Fast is constantly working to integrate with additional eCommerce platforms. If your store runs on an eCommerce platform not listed among our [supported platforms](/developer-portal/for-developers/platforms.mdx), talk to one of our representatives using this [form](https://v2.fast.co/contact-sales). We may still be able to help you.
