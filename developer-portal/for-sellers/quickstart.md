# Fast Seller Quickstart

Welcome to Fast!

Seller onboarding is incredibly important to us – both in ease of use and enjoying the outcomes from installing Fast Checkout everywhere you can put a button and increase your revenue.

This section contains all you need to know to install our Checkout button, step-by-step. Start by making sure Fast Checkout is for you, then set aside (or ask your developer) a bit of time to gather up your documents (like bank account and website server information) to literally get down to business.

:::info Note
We’re here to help at any stage of the process, so if you run into any confusion or have any questions, reach out to us at **seller-support@fast.co**
