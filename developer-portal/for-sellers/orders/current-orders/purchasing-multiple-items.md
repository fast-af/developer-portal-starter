# Purchasing Multiple Items

Fast batches multiple transactions made by a single Shopper within the 5-minute checkout window, to limit effects on your Average Order Value (AOV) or shipping costs. All orders placed within the 5-minute checkout window will compile into one batched order for processing by the Seller, whose system will determine appropriate shipping costs and times for the items in the order. If the Shopper purchases an additional item within the 5-minute checkout window, the timer then resets.

::: attention Seller Agreement Fixed Fee
Please note that each payment will incur the fixed fee as set forth in the applicable Seller agreement (which is primarily a fee that Fast pays to relevant banks). However, this fee can be offset by a lift in conversion and sales via Fast Checkout.
