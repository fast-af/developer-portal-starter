# Cancelled orders

Orders may be cancelled by Fast for a variety of reasons:

- Payment method declined
- No inventory (out of stock)
- Shipping or billing address is incomplete
- Selected shipping option is not available

If an order is cancelled due to a payment or inventory issue, Fast will reach out to the customer directly. You should not fulfill the order, but you may see the order appear in your Seller Dashboard as a payment decline and in your eCommerce platform as a cancelled order.
