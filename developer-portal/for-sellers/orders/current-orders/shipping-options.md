# Shipping Options

The shipping options presented to the customer are the shipping options you have enabled on BigCommerce / WooCommerce and will be available to the customer during the 5-minute checkout process. During the 5-minute checkout process the buyer has the ability to update their shipping method. If no shipping method is selected the default will be whichever option is least expensive to the customer.
