# How you get paid

Fast Checkout payments are paid regularly to your bank account. Once you have filled out your Business Details and Bank Details, you will receive regular payouts into your bank account for payments made on your store through Fast Checkout.

> Note: The first payout may take up to 7-14 days after receiving your first successful payment, as your account is being established. Subsequent payouts will arrive in your bank in 1-2 business days.
