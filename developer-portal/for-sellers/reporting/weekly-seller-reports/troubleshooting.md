# Weekly Seller Reports Troubleshooting

## I have not received the Weekly Seller Report, what should I do?

Here are some common reasons for not receiving the report:

- The current time is before the scheduled weekly send time
  - We should send the Weekly Seller Report every Tuesday by 7am in the recipient's local time.
- Fast does not send a Weekly Seller Report if your store does not have any Fast transactions in the prior week.
- You are currently not on the distribution list for the report.
  - Please refer to the [Subscribing to the Weekly Seller Report page](./subscribing.md) for instructions on how to subscribe.
