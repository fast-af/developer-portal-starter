# Weekly seller reports troubleshooting

## I have not received the Weekly Seller Report, what should I do?

Here are some common reasons for not receiving the report:

- The current time is before the scheduled weekly send time. (We send it out every Tuesday by 7am local time)
- Fast does not send a Weekly Seller Report if your store does not have any Fast transactions in the prior week.
- You are currently not on the distribution list for the report. See instructions above on how to subscribe.
