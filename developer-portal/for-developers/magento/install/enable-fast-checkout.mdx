   />
3. In the Configuration screen, navigate to **Services → Fast Checkout**.\

4. Enter your configuration details in the relevant fields:\

   <img alt="configuration form" src="./images/image4.png" />

   - Set the module to _Enabled_ on the appropriate store(s). This is a store-level configuration setting that allows you to quickly enable or disable Fast.

   - Enter your **Access Token** and **Fast App ID** given to you from Fast. This should be the sandbox credentials for initial testing.

   - If capturing up front, select **Enable Auth+Capture**.

   Completing this step will also create an integration record and payment method for your store. The integration record is used so that Fast can communicate with Magento REST APIs as part of the order process. The payment method will be included for orders placed through Fast Checkout.
