# Install Fast on Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC)

This section includes instructions for installing the **Fast Salesforce Reference Architecture (SFRA) Cartridge for Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC)**. If you're the store owner for your eCommerce platform, but have a designated Commerce Cloud Business Manager admin, work with developers, or collaborate with a third-party Systems Integrator, this section is for them.

We will cover allowing customers to place Fast orders through your Salesforce Commerce Cloud site, including placement details for the Fast Checkout button.
