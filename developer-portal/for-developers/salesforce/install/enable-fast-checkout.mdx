     Administration → Sites → Manage Sites → {site_id} → Settings
   - In the Settings tab, **add `int_fast_sfra` to the Effective Cartridge Path** (e.g. `int_fast_sfra:app_storefront_base`, as Cartridge names must be provided as a colon-separated list)

## Create a Business Manager user for your storefront

A Business Manager user is needed to connect the Open Commerce API (OCAPI) to Fast.

1. Navigate to **Administration > Users**.
   - If you have the proper permissions you should see a **Create Users** button here.
2. Follow the instructions [described here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/b2c-configure-users-roles-permissions/b2c-admin-configure-business-manager-users) to create a new user.

     videoTitle="Create a Business Manager User"
   />

1. In the SFCC Account Manager, go to the **API Client** tab, and click **Add API Client**.
   ![Add API Client from Account Manager](./images/account-manager-add-fast-api-client.png)

2. The API Client ID and Password produced during this step will be used by your Fast Delivery Team to generate a Sandbox App ID (`app_id`) for your store.

### Configure Fast Checkout button settings

1. Navigate to **Merchant Tools > Custom Preferences > Fast Configs**.

2. Set the following values:
   - **Instance Type**:
     - During initial testing, set Instance Type to "Sandbox".
     - Instance Type should only be changed to "Production" after Fast has evaluated your Sandbox setup and you are ready to go live with your changes.
   - **Fast JS URL**:
     - Sandbox: "https://js.sandbox.fast.co/fast.js"
     - Production: "https://js.fast.co/fast.js"
   - **Fast Enabled**:
     - Set to "Enabled."
     - This is a store-level setting that allows you to quickly enable or disable Fast.
   - **Fast App ID**:
     - Enter the Sandbox App ID (`app_id`) provided to you previously by Fast.
     - You must have already [created an API client](#create-an-api-client-for-fast) so that the Fast Delivery Team can generate a Sandbox App ID for your store. You will not obtain a production Fast App ID (`app_id`) until your Sandbox setup has been validated by Fast.
       <embed src="/reusables/for-developers/_fast_app_id.md" />
   - **Fast Theme**:
     - If you set the theme to Dark, it will make the button appear white.

   | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `cartridge/templates/default/common/layout/page.isml`     | Include the `fast.js` file in the HTML Head of your storefront to enable Fast features |
