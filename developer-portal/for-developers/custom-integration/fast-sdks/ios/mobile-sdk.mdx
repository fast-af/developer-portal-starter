# Set Up the SDK

Getting started with the iOS SDK requires four steps:

1. [Install the SDK](#install-the-sdk)
2. [Configure your app](#configure-your-app)
3. [Use Fast Checkout](#use-fast-checkout)
4. [Handle Fast Events](#handle-fast-events)

## Install the SDK

You have several options on how to install the Fast SDK, described below.

### With CocoaPods

1. If you haven't already, [install the latest version of CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
2. In the terminal, run the following command from your project root to create a _Podfile_:

   ```bash
   pod init
   ```

3. Add this line to your Podfile:

   ```bash
   pod 'FastKit'
   ```

4. Add dependencies and generate an .xcworkspace:

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

### As .xcframework

A package manager like Cocoapods is recommended to ensure easy updates, but Fast can also be added to your app directly.

:::warning DOWNLOAD LINK MISSING
Let me know how to link
:::

1. Download the latest version of **FastKit.xcframework**
2. Drag and drop the **FastKit.xcframework** file into the project navigator in XCode, and ensure all relevant targets are selected.
3. Navigate to your project's settings. In the _General_ tab, add **FastKit.xcframework** under the _Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content_ section. Make sure “Embed & Sign” is selected.

## Configure Your App

<embed src="/reusables/for-developers/_platform_all_sign_up_as_a_seller_banner_sandbox_and_contact_support.md" />

In your AppDelegate's _didFinishLaunchingWithOptions_(...) method, configure FastKit with your **Fast App Id**:

```swift
Fast.shared.configure(appId: "YOUR_FAST_APP_ID")
```

On pages where you want the **FastCheckoutButton** to appear, generate the button and add it to your view hierarchy.

```swift
// Create and add the Fast Checkout Button
let button = Fast.shared.createFastCheckoutButton()
view.addSubview(button)

// Note: Don't forget to handle the tap action!
button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(invokeFastCheckout), for: .touchUpInside)
```

## Use Fast Checkout

<MobileInvokeCheckout
  sdkModuleName="FastKit"
  actionType="handler"
  actionName="FastCheckoutButton"
/>

The SDK provides 2 main routes for invoking checkout:

1. [Checkout with a List of Products](#checkout-with-a-list-of-products)
2. [Checkout with a Cart ID](#checkout-with-a-cart-id)

<MobileProductOptionsWarning sdkFullName="Fast iOS SDK" />

### Checkout with a List of Products

Pass in a list of products. A `Product` is a struct describing the item being ordered:

```swift
/// Present the Fast Checkout flow.
/// - presentedBy: The presenting view controller for the Fast Checkout flow.
/// - products: The list of products the user is ordering,
/// - couponCode: A discount code that the user might have entered.
/// - callback: A callback to listen for events during checkout.
public func checkout(
	presentedBy: UIViewController,
	products: [Product],
	couponCode: String,
	callback: @escaping (FastEvent) -> Void
)
```

#### Product Object Breakdown

The `Product` object describes any product that can be ingested by the Fast backend and thus purchased via the SDK.

| Name              | Type              | Description                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| platformProductId | String            | The product identifier.                                           |
| platformVariantId | String?           | A unique sub-identifier for this product.                         |
| productOptions    | [`ProductOption`] | Configurable properties of this Product (e.g. color, size, etc.). |
| quantity          | Int               | The number of this item that should be purchased.                 |

#### ProductOption Breakdown

A `ProductOption` is a configuration that further describes the product being ordered (e.g. _ProductOption(id: "color", value: "blue"))._

| Name       | Type   | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| identifier | String | The identifier of the product option or configuration. |
| value      | String | The value of the specified option.                     |

### Checkout with a Cart ID

Pass in a `cartId` that the Fast backend can break into a list of products and, if applicable, any discount code.

```swift
/// Present the Fast Checkout flow.
/// - cartId: Unique identifier for a user's cart.
/// - couponCode: A discount code that the user might have entered.
/// - callback: A callback to listen for events during checkout.
public func checkout(
	presentedBy: UIViewController,
	cartId: String,
	couponCode: String,
	callback: @escaping (FastEvent) -> Void
)
```

## Handle Fast Events

The SDK will communicate with the seller app via callback as the user performs actions to progress through the checkout flow.

### Callbacks

The callback will include a `FastEvent` parameter. No action is required by your app when these events are fired—they are purely for transparency within the checkout flow.

### FastEvent

A `FastEvent` is emitted by the SDK at key stages during the checkout flow. Your app can handle these via the checkout `callback` parameter.

| Name      | Type                    | Description                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| eventType | FastEventType           | An enum describing the event.                 |
| info      | [FastEventInfoKey: Any] | Additional relevant data regarding the event. |

### FastEventType

```swift
/// The outcome of the Fast checkout flow.
public enum FastEventType: Int {
  /// Emitted when the order has been submitted through Fast Checkout.
  case orderCreated = 0
  /// Emitted when the order has changed while inside the Fast Checkout.
  case orderUpdated = 1
  /// Emitted when the order has been finalized from inside Fast Checkout,
  /// either when the post-purchase order batching window times out or
  /// when Fast Checkoug is manually dismissed.
  case orderCompleted = 2
  /// Emitted when the order has been cancelled from inside Fast Checkout
  case orderCancelled = 3
  /// Emitted when checkout has failed with an error.
  case orderFailed = 4
}
```

### FastEventInfoKey

An enum describing a parameter from within the `FastEvent` payload.

### Mobile SDK Events

For additional details, please refer to [iOS SDK Events](./mobile-events).

### Sign Out

<MobileSignout sdkFullName="Fast iOS SDK" signoutMethod="signUserOut()" />

```swift
// Sign out current user and clear cached credentials.
Fast.shared.signUserOut()
```
