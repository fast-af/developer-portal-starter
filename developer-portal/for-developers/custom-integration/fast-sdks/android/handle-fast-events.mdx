# Handle Fast Android SDK Events

The Fast SDK will send events that convey information about the user's shopping journey through the Fast checkout flow. The SDK will communicate with the seller app via callbacks as the user performs actions within the checkout flow.

### Callbacks

As the user progresses through the Fast checkout experience, callbacks will notify your app about significant events. You can listen for these events by passing in a callback object. You will need to define the method in your activity / fragment to listen to callbacks.

```kotlin
private fun onFastCheckoutEvent(event: FastCheckoutEvent) {
    when (event) {
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderCanceled -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderCanceled: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderCompleted -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderCompleted: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderCreated -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderCreated: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderFailed -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderFailed: ${event.throwable}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderUpdated -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderUpdated: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        else -> Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: Unhandled event: $event")
    }
}
```

### Android SDK Callback Events

The Fast SDK will send events which convey information about the user's shopping journey through the Fast checkout flow. The `FastCheckoutEvent` contains these events.

| Event            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Associated Data |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `OrderCreated`   | Emitted when the order has been successfully submitted through Fast Checkout.                                                                                                                                                                   | PurchaseInfo    |
| `OrderUpdated`   | Emitted when buyer updates order information like item quantity, removes an item, or adds a coupon.                                                                                                                                             | PurchaseInfo    |
| `OrderCompleted` | Emitted when order is finalized. This means that the batching window has ended and the user cannot update the order. If the user closes the SDK before batching window has ended, you won't get this event and instead get the SDKClosed event. | PurchaseInfo    |
| `OrderCanceled`  | Emitted when user cancels the order.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PurchaseInfo    |
| `OrderFailed`    | Emitted when checkout fails with an error                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Throwable?      |
| `SDKClosed`      | Buyer has exited the Fast Android SDK                                                                                                                                                                                                           | None            |

:::info

Please note that `OrderFailed` (indicating a checkout failure) emits a `Throwable?`, which is a nullable `kotlin.Throwable` object that wraps an error.
