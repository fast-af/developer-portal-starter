## Confirm that the copy you just made is active

   - To do this, confirm that the name of your backup copy is listed under _Current Theme_.
     - It might also have a word like "light" or "warm."
   - If, for any reason, the copy is not active, reach out to Customer Success at [**seller-support@fast.co**](mailto:seller-support@fast.co) for help.\
